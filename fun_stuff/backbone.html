        <p> Origins: I was born in August of 2001 in Western Washington and I spent my first 20 years living in Washington. When I was 7 years old, my mother started to teach me how to play the piano and I eventually started to take piano lessons. However, lessons became something I dreaded and I quit after a couple of years. I listened to a lot of early 2000s rock and pop but I didn't start getting passionate about music until I was 14 years old.</p>

        <p>Music History: Before this time in my life, I had enjoyed a variety of music but it wasn’t until this time of my life that I started to get emotionally invested in rock music. I started to listen to bands like Linkin Park and Fall Out Boy religiously and this music helped me get through some dark times. I eventually started to take guitar lessons and I eventually started to have a passion for metal. I started to listen to bands like A Day To Remember and Of Mice and Men. I heard the unclean vocals or screams in their songs and I wanted to learn how to do that so I decided to teach myself how to scream.

            At 16 years old, I took a piano class at my high school and I gained a new love for piano that I did not have before and I also started to learn how to play bass guitar.
            
            While I did enjoy learning songs, I was obsessed with writing my own songs and I even created a band named “Evergreen” in 2017. We did not accomplish much and the band ended in 2018. I continued to explore music and I learned how to write songs by myself.</p>
