        <p> Origins: I was born in August of 2001 in Western Washington and I spent my first 20 years in Washington. Even from a young age, I had a passion for music. I was always either dancing to music or spending time listening to music on the computer or on the old school ipods. When I was 7 years old, my mother started to teach me how to play the piano and I eventually started to take piano lessons. Like many other kids, I did not enjoy the music that I was playing and after 2 years, I quit. Eventually I decided to pursue running as a passion like much of my family had but when I was 14, I ran into some medical problems that caused me extreme fatigue and I wasn’t able to run like I wanted to. I turned to music to give me a purpose.</p>

        <p>Music History: Before this time in my life, I had enjoyed a variety of music but it wasn’t until this time of my life that I started to get emotionally invested in rock music. I started to listen to bands like Linkin Park and Fall Out Boy religiously and this music helped me get through some dark times. I eventually started to take guitar lessons and I eventually started to have a passion for metal. I started to listen to bands like A Day To Remember and Of Mice and Men. I heard the unclean vocals or screams in their songs and I wanted to learn how to do that so I decided to teach myself how to scream.

            At 16 years old, I took a piano class at my high school and I gained a new love for piano that I did not have before and I also started to learn how to play bass guitar.
            
            While I did enjoy learning songs, I was obsessed with writing my own songs and I even created a band named “Evergreen” in 2017. We only played one show at our High School and we didn't release any songs. Our band didn’t last long and I realized that if I wanted to write songs, I was going to do everything myself.</p>

        <p> Released Music: In October 2019, I started to write my own EP. I finished the EP in August of 2020 and I released it on Soundcloud but after a couple of weeks, I decided that it wasn’t ready yet. I deleted the EP and I started to write new songs. I wrote a new EP named Generic that was released January of 2021. From July to December of 2021, I released 4 singles.</p>
