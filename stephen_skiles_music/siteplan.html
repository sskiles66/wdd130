      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> This elevator pitch will be for a music page for myself. I am a metal musician and this will be a website that introduces who I am and my music/messages. The webpage needs to be inviting, clean, neat and informational. 

        The main home page will contain a picture of me and a summary of who I am. There will also be links in the header that say “home”, “music”, and “videos”. Each page will have some social media links at the bottom.
  
        After giving my presentation to three individuals, they suggested to me to give some more description of how the website is going to look but besides that they said that my pitch was good.

        Below the header, there will be a vertical photo of me in the center and on the sides there will be pictures that will have borders and box shadows. These pictures will be the covers of the most recent music that I have released and there will be links below each one that link to YouTube, Itunes, and Spotify. People that come to my website will be able to quickly know where to go to listen to my music. Below this there will be some text where I share a good scripture.There is not going to be much text on this page and the quote will be the only text on the page that won’t be a link.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        Content:
	
	On the home page, there was my most recent music. On this page there will be all of the music that I have released and there will be short summaries of what each song is about. There will be about 1 song in each row that has the picture of the cover of the song and there will also be the title of the song and the date it was released and the summary below each song. 
      </p>
      <p>A Remnant of the Past:
        Sometimes we feel forgotten by family and friends and we wonder if there is something we could have done. Our existence seems to be only part of the past.
      </p>
      <p>The Pendulum:
        We all have weaknesses and temptations that drive us off the path of happiness. This song is about fighting back what we know deep down is not right.
      </p>
      <p>The Reckoning:
        Life is not fair and sometimes there will be people that do not face justice in this world. Faith in justice after this life will be important to find peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Light Rises:
        This song shares my experience of becoming an active Christian. The darkness of my life before doesn’t matter now that I have the light of Christ in my life.
      </p>
      <p>Generic (EP)
        This was my first released EP and these songs share my experiences with lost friends, overcoming a regretful past and looking forward to a bright future.
      </p>
      <p>Jingle Hells:
        First released song (and you can tell) and this song doesn't really have a significant meaning. It's just Jingle Bells but in a minor key, it was a blast to write though.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Content:
	
	On this page, there will be some basic information about where I am from and then there will also be some information about my musical history. I’ll explain when and how I got into music and when I started to learn different instruments and how I formed a band at one point in time. This will all lead up until my officially released songs and to the present day. If people listen to my music and are curious about my history, they will have an easy method of learning more about me.

      </p>

      <p>Origins:
        I was born in August of 2001 in Western Washington and I spent my first 20 years in Washington. Even from a young age, I had a passion for music. I was always either dancing to music or spending time listening to music on the computer or on the old school ipods. When I was 7 years old, my mother started to teach me how to play the piano and I eventually started to take piano lessons. Like many other kids, I did not enjoy the music that I was playing and after 2 years, I quit. Eventually I decided to pursue running as a passion like much of my family had but when I was 14, I ran into some medical problems that caused me extreme fatigue and I wasn’t able to run like I wanted to. I turned to music to give me a purpose.
        </p>
      <p>Music History:

        Before this time in my life, I had enjoyed a variety of music but it wasn’t until this time of my life that I started to get emotionally invested in rock music. I started to listen to bands like Linkin Park and Fall Out Boy religiously and this music helped me get through some dark times. 
        
        I eventually started to take guitar lessons and I eventually started to have a passion for metal. I started to listen to bands like A Day To Remember and Of Mice and Men. I heard the unclean vocals or screams in their songs and I wanted to learn how to do that so I decided to teach myself how to scream.
        </p>

        <p>At 16 years old, I took a piano class at my high school and I gained a new love for piano that I did not have before and I also started to learn how to play bass guitar.
        </p>

        <p>While I did enjoy learning songs, I was obsessed with writing my own songs and I even created a band named “Evergreen” in 2017. We only played one show at our High School and we didn't release any songs. Our band didn’t last long and I realized that if I wanted to write songs, I was going to do everything myself. 
        </p>

        <p>Released Music:

          In October 2019, I started to write my own EP. I finished the EP in August of 2020 and I released it on Soundcloud but after a couple of weeks, I decided that it wasn’t ready yet. I deleted the EP and I started to write new songs. I wrote a new EP named Generic that was released January of 2021. 
          
          From July to December of 2021, I released 4 singles.
          </p>

          <p>What Now?:

            I am currently going to school at Brigham Young University to pursue a Computer Science degree. Definitely don’t have as much time for music that I used to but I am continually trying to write more songs.
